line-by-line profiling for code executed by pytest, using [line-profiler](https://github.com/pyutils/line_profiler).

## Why?

Line profiler is a wonderful tool to easily identify bottlenecks inside specific functions of your code, and quantify the improvements after a refactor. 

Using it is straightforward but required to instrument the functions you want to profile with a "virtual" `@profile` decorator
and then execute "a trigger script" (code that calls the decorated functions somehow) via `kernprof.py` which works as a python wrapper that understands the decorator, register the functions to be profiled, and print the stats when the script finishes.   

Altought it does its job, is a bit invasive: you need to have an special "instrumented" version of your code, 
and execute it in a way that potentially clashes with the way you do normally (for instance, through a shortcut command from your editor, a test runner, another script, etc.)   

Moreover, frequently in real case scenarios, "a trigger script" isn't just a simple function call. 
You need to prepare input data, connect to external resources, etc.  And that's exactly what a test can do, right?    

## Installation 

You can install "pytest-line-profiler" via pip from PyPI.

```
$ pip install pytest-line-profiler
```

## Usage


Mark your test passing the functions you wants to profile as positional arguments, 
like `@pytest.mark.line_profile.with_args(function1, function2, [...])`

If your test exercises any of those functions, you'll get the profile result as a report.  

For example:

```python
import pytest

def f(i):
    return i * 10

def g(n=10):
    return sum(f(i) for i in range(10))


@pytest.mark.line_profile.with_args(f, g)
def test_as_mark():
    assert g() == 450

```


After that test is executed, you'll get the stats from the line profiler instance.

     8         1         30.0     30.0    100.0      return sum(f(i) for i in range(10))
```


Alternatively, you can run any test passing the function/s to profile from the command line

```
$ pytest --line-profile path.to.function_to_be_profiled [...] 
```

The `line-profiler` library offer flexibility to change the output time units, to change the default output time unit you can set `output_unit` in the function decorator.
For example: 
```python

@pytest.mark.line_profile.with_args(f, g, output_unit=1e-3)
def test_as_mark():
    assert g() == 450

```
